::: {#hero-heading}

I am an architect and a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on building performance during extreme heat events. More broadly, I examine indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption in buildings, with particular attention to how the evolution of the urban built environment affects these factors. I also investigate how urban morphological changes influence urban heat dynamics, ultimately shaping human health, comfort, and well-being. I conduct extensive geospatial analyses to track Nairobi’s urban transformation, particularly changes in land cover, such as urban open spaces, canopy cover, and built-up areas. Alongside unregulated urban densification, these changes intensify urban heat stress and further undermine broader urban climate resilience. I examine these issues through the lens of inequality, as the greatest burden is disproportionately borne by the most vulnerable  urban communities and neighbourhoods. Much of my work involves using Google Earth Engine + (R&Python). I am a strong advocate for the democratisation of urban analytics and am deeply committed to promoting open-source tools and methods that help overcome data scarcity, especially in cities across the Global South as I believe this will open doors for formulation of more targeted and robust policies.
