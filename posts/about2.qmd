## About Me

I am an architect with a passion for computational and evidence-based design approaches to address pressing environmental challenges such as urban heat, building thermal performance, and climate resilience in the built environment.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} within the Sustainable Design Group, supervised by Professor Ronita Bardhan. My research focuses on assessing the thermal resilience of buildings under present and projected climate scenarios, with particular attention to African cities.

My work explores how globalisation-driven transformations in facade design and building envelope materials influence thermal performance during extreme heat events, especially under long-term climate projections.

Beyond individual buildings, I am interested in the relationship between urban form and human health, particularly the growing risks of urban heat stress in rapidly urbanising regions. My research examines how urbanisation, informality, socio-economic inequality, density patterns, green infrastructure, and climate change interact to shape thermal vulnerability in cities such as Nairobi.
